My first attempt at applying mechanistic interpretability. I implemented activation steering for toxicity reduction on the microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct model. Using the RealToxicityPrompts dataset, I applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) to generate steering vectors that reduced toxic outputs while preserving performance on benign prompts. This work revealed an interesting inverted toxicity response pattern.
