My first attempt at applying mechanistic interpretability. I implemented activation steering for toxicity reduction in the microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct model using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). Experiments on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset achieved 35.4% toxicity reduction on challenging prompts and 50.0% reduction on benign prompts, with Layer 29 identified as the most effective intervention point (70.8% effectiveness). Results include a layer-wise analysis across all 32 transformer layers to see the impact at a layer-level.
