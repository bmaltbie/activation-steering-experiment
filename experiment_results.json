              "researchers from the University of Plymouth and the University of Exeter have shown that the presence of a single species of sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, can have a significant impact on the diversity of other species in a marine ecosystem. The study found that when the sea star population was reduced, the diversity of other species, such as mussels and barnacles, increased. This suggests that the sea star plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem by preventing any one species from becoming too dominant. The researchers believe that this finding has important implications for conservation efforts, as it highlights the importance of protecting keystone species like the sea star",
